## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Usage

### Running Specific Function from Command Line

**Note:** The tool is designed for interactive use through the menu. For automation needs, see the "Creating a Custom Automation Script" section below.

**Current Limitation:** The `Optimize-Windows.ps1` script automatically starts the interactive tool when executed, so you cannot directly dot-source it (import its functions) to call individual functions. 

If you need to automate specific optimization tasks, you have two options:

1. **Use the interactive tool** - Launch it and manually select options
2. **Create a custom automation script** - See the section below for examples

**Understanding the Menu Options (Reference):**

The functions below are what power each menu option in the interactive tool. This list helps you understand what each menu option does internally and can guide you in creating custom automation scripts.

- `Get-SystemInfo` - Display system information (Menu option [1])
- `Clear-TemporaryFiles` - Remove temporary files (Menu option [2])
- `Start-DiskCleanup` - Run Windows Disk Cleanup (Menu option [3])
- `Optimize-Services` - Disable non-essential services (Menu option [4])
- `Optimize-VisualEffects` - Adjust visual effects for performance (Menu option [5])
- `Optimize-Network` - Reset network settings (Menu option [6])
- `Optimize-Drives` - Optimize drives (TRIM/defrag) (Menu option [7])
- `Clear-WindowsUpdateCache` - Clear Windows Update cache (Menu option [8])
- `Test-SystemHealth` - Run System File Checker (Menu option [9])
- `Start-AllOptimizations` - Run all safe optimizations (Menu option [A])

### Scheduled Automation

**Note:** The current version of the tool is designed for interactive use. For true automation, you would need to create a custom script or modify the tool to support command-line parameters.

For now, you can schedule reminders to run the tool manually:

1. Open Task Scheduler (`taskschd.msc`)
2. Create New Task
3. Set trigger (e.g., Monthly on 1st day)
4. Set action:
   - Program: `powershell.exe`
   - Arguments: `-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoProfile -Command "& 'C:\path\to\Start-WindowsOptimizer.ps1'"`
5. Set to run with highest privileges

**This will launch the interactive tool where you can then select option [A] for all optimizations.**

### Creating a Custom Automation Script

If you need true unattended automation, create a custom wrapper script:

```powershell
# MyAutomatedOptimization.ps1
# This is a template for creating your own automation

# Check admin privileges
if (-not ([Security.Principal.WindowsPrincipal][Security.Principal.WindowsIdentity]::GetCurrent()).IsInRole([Security.Principal.WindowsBuiltInRole]::Administrator)) {
    Write-Host "Requires Administrator privileges"
    exit
}

# Clear temp files manually
$tempFolders = @("$env:TEMP", "$env:WINDIR\Temp")
foreach ($folder in $tempFolders) {
    Get-ChildItem $folder -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Remove-Item -Force -Recurse -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
}

# Run disk cleanup
Start-Process cleanmgr.exe -ArgumentList "/sagerun:1" -Wait -NoNewWindow

# Add other optimizations as needed
```

## üîß Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: "Cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"
**Solution:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Or use: `.\Start-WindowsOptimizer.ps1` (handles this automatically)

### Issue: "Administrator privileges required"
**Solution:**
- Close PowerShell
- Right-click PowerShell icon
- Select "Run as Administrator"
- Try again

Or use: `.\Start-WindowsOptimizer.ps1` (auto-elevates)

### Issue: Setup.ps1 doesn't launch the tool
**Solution:**
Run with `-NoLaunch` parameter:
```powershell
.\Setup.ps1 -NoLaunch
```
Then launch manually:
```powershell
.\Optimize-Windows.ps1
```

### Issue: Desktop shortcut doesn't work
**Solution:**
Create it manually during setup:
```powershell
.\Setup.ps1 -CreateShortcut
```

### Issue: Some temp files couldn't be deleted
**Solution:**
- Normal behavior for files in use
- Close all programs and try again
- Run immediately after restart
